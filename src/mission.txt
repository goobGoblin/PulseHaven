- Put your fucking phone away and dance
- Pulsating rhythms and grooves
- A safe haven for creativity and self-expression


- Music and Art collective focused on curating intimate experiences and a safe space to express yourself on the dancefloor
- A reprieve from the mundane, stressful, sometimes soul-crushing experience of surviving in a capitalist world, where the music envelops, the dancefloor unites, and the outside world fades away
- Music is a universal language, long before words took shape, music connected us, we are dedicated to tapping into those primal urges hard-coded into our DNA to foster pure escapism through rhythm and movement
- In our spaces, we invite you to disconnect, to stow your phone and let go of daily stresses.
- Join us, and be part of something greater: an organism in harmony on the dancefloor, where each beat is a heartbeat, and every movement is a shared breath of freedom and joy.
